This was done in order to better understand the impact of the Thomas Fire that occured in 2017-2018. Because the Thomas Fire burned from Ventura north, we wanted to further understand how it impacted Santa Barbara and Goleta which is slightly further north, but could have had differing impacts due to wind. The jittered points prevent overlapping so you can see the distribution clearly. \n\n\n\nOutput"

When I was about 12 I started doing competitions through a program called NSSA with my best friend. I would travel up and down the coast practicing and getting better. In high school I also continued to compete for my high schools surf team, my dad was also the coach! And it didnt end when I graduated high school, I then got on the UCSB surf team and continue to surf and compete for the team now. I am so grateful to have this hobby that allows me to immerse myself in the ocean and feel so grounded in nature.

I love traveling because it allows me to explore new places, experience different cultures, and see the world from fresh perspectives. On my most recent adventure, I studied abroad in Australia. After school, seven friends and I traveled down the East Coast of Australia in a motorhome, from Brisbane to Sydney. We then flew to New Zealand, where we explored the North Island in another motorhome, chasing waves and embracing the spirit of adventure. Below is a little collage of some of the adventures during my time away!\n\n\n\nTravel collage\n\n\nBelow I created a map of all of the places that I traveled after my study abroad! I used the leaflet package to create an interactive portion so you can click on each point to show what town/country it is in."
